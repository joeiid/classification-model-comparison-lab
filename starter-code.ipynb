    "- Good data science problem: \"Does an association exist between obesity and blood pressure?\"\n",
    "    - This is more specific and is conclusively answerable. The problem specifically is asking for a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer. Based on that, two independent people should both be able to say either \"Yes, the problem has been answered\" or \"No, the problem has not yet been answered.\"\n",

(For example, a client may not understand what it means to have multiple models, or if you're using an algorithm to make a decision, it's probably pretty challenging to use two or more algorithms simultaneously.) It's not always an easy choice, but you'll have to make it soon enough. Pick a model and defend why you picked this model!"
